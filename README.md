This project was completed by a team of four, using the open-source Zomato Dataset from Kaggle to build a model that predicts whether a food delivery order will be delayed. 
We began by collaboratively discussing the data preprocessing strategy. 
One team member was responsible for writing the preprocessing code, while the other three focused on model development and data visualization. 
My role was to build and train the predictive model, which involved selecting appropriate algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating model performance.
